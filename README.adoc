* https://calconnect.github.io/cc-itip-participants/[CalConnect+IETF: Calendaring and scheduling -- iTip scheduling using participants (HTML)]

== General

This document specifies a new iTip method, "PARTICIPANTS", which is used to
request a list of participants for a calendar object. The "PARTICIPANTS" method
enables clients to query the organizer or other authoritative source for the
current list of participants associated with a calendar event. This method is
particularly useful in scenarios where the participant list may change over
time, and clients need to ensure they have the most up-to-date information.

The "PARTICIPANTS" method is used in the same way as the existing iTip methods
"REQUEST", "REPLY", "CANCEL", "ADD", "REFRESH", and "COUNTER". It follows the
same iTip message structure and transport mechanisms, ensuring compatibility
with existing calendaring and scheduling systems.

When a "PARTICIPANTS" request is sent, the recipient processes the request and
responds with a list of participants, including their roles and statuses. This
response allows the requesting client to update its local representation of the
event's participant list, ensuring consistency across different clients and
systems.

In summary, the "PARTICIPANTS" method enhances the iTip protocol by providing a
standardized way to query and synchronize participant information for calendar
events, improving the accuracy and reliability of scheduling data.
